#What is Wondertron?

Wondertron is a theme for [WonderCMS](http://www.wondercms.com) based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com). It includes additional features, such as an AJAX contact form.

# Readme

To install this theme, just unzip `wondertron.zip` into your "themes" folder in WonderCMS. (It should automatically expand into a folder called 'wondertron').

You can also just download the `public_html` folder, which includes a default WonderCMS (v0.6 BETA) installation.

If you are installing `wondertron.zip` into your own WonderCMS installation (not using the `public_html` folder included here), you will need to make one modification to your index.php file. Around line 22, add:

    include ('themes/wondertron/default-content.php');

If you have any trouble, please open an issue on the github repo at [https://github.com/cristoslc/Wondertron/issues](https://github.com/cristoslc/Wondertron/issues)
