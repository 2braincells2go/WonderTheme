{"name":"The WonderTheme","tagline":"Bootstrap 3 Based Theme for WonderCMS","body":"# JANUARY 2016 -- New Life?\r\nThe main focus will be for use in classroom/local intranet development but should work on most current webservers.\r\n\r\nWhy not fork it and help make better! Looking for those that wish to implement other WYSISWYG editors such as Ckeditor (w/filemanger) or similar.\r\n\r\n#What is WonderTheme?\r\n\r\nWondertheme is a special theme for [WonderCMS (v0.6 BETA)](http://www.wondercms.com) based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com). It includes additional features, such as an AJAX contact form.\r\n\r\n#Demo\r\nLive demo is available at [http://wondertheme.ml](http://wondertheme.ml).\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\nTo install this theme, just unzip `wondertron.zip` into your \"themes\" folder in WonderCMS. (It should automatically expand into a folder called 'wondertron').\r\n\r\nYou can also download the `public_html` folder to the target directory of your site, which includes a WonderCMS (v0.6 BETA) installation.\r\n\r\nIf you are installing `wondertron.zip` into your own WonderCMS installation (not using the `public_html` folder included here), you will need to make one modification to your index.php file. Around line 22, add:\r\n\r\n    include ('themes/wondertron/default-content.php');\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
